                    <h3>What is Gom Jabbar Test</h3>
                    <p>The Gom Jabbar, also known as "the high handed enemy", was a handheld needle tipped with meta-cyanide poison. When driven into a victim it brought almost instantaneous death.</p>
                    <p> The gom jabbar test would be to determine whether an individual's awareness was stronger than their instincts. If their awareness of the gom jabbar's presence was strong enough, it would override their instincts to withdraw from the
                        test, which usually involved great physical pain.</p>
                    <p>The Bene Gesserit also made extensive use of the Gom Jabbar, especially when they tested the humanity of certain individuals. In such circumstances, the device was placed against the subject's neck and acted as a deterrent for them
                        backing out of the test. Such a method was used by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam against Paul Atreides before his arrival on Arrakis.</p>
